    <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>Hello there! My name is Rima. I have worked in the technology field for the past 5 years. I have taken on customer centric roles such as helping customers use products, assisting them in resolving product issues, and training them on how to efficiently and effectively use different platforms. However, I have been itching to become the one that MAKES the product and deliver the best solutions to customers. I decided to start my journey to becoming a full stack Web Developer by studying on my own as well taking the Codding Bootcamp at The Univeristy of Texas at Austin. This journey have been nothing short of exciting and I am looking forward to what my future as a woman in tech holds</p>
